# WebscraperGUI

This is a simple Python web scraper that retrieves and displays the top stories from the Hackernews website. It uses the following libraries:

- tkinter - for creating the GUI
- BeautifulSoup - for parsing the HTML content of the website
- requests - for making HTTP requests to the website
- webbrowser - for opening links in the default browser

## How to use
To use the web scraper, simply click the "Start scraping" button in the GUI. This will retrieve the top stories from the first three pages of Hackernews and display them in a table. The table includes columns for the story title, the link to the story, and the number of votes the story has received.

You can double-click on any row in the table to open the link in your default web browser.
